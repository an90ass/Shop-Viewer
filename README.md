Download the db.json file: Place the db.json file in the root directory of your project.

Install JSON Server: Make sure you have Node.js installed, then install json-server globally:

bash
npm install -g json-server
Run the API server: In the root folder where db.json is located, run the following command:

bash
json-server --watch db.json
This will start a server at http://localhost:3000 where the API will serve the data.

Run the Flutter app: After ensuring the API server is running, start the Flutter application:

bash
flutter run
